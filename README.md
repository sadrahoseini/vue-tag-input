# &lt;TagInput/&gt; Project

This is a small project developed with Vue 3 in Vite.

The main idea is creating reuseable tag-input component for vue 3 as a code challenge.

We use [Mirage.js](https://miragejs.com/) to create a mock server for test API, Also use ```axios``` to fetch API urls.

## Tests âœ…

For testing of our components Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and check if user stories which defined for our components working correcly, we use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) testing library which has greate integrations for Vue.js apps, also projects that created with Vite.

If you want check test writen for component simply run this command:

```sh
npx cypress open
```

After cypress's dev-server running correctly you can select ```component testing``` and testing ```browser```, then from list of ```specs``` defined in cypress web app, check all stories work correctly or have any error for each part.
